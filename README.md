## About Sentient Chairs of Skyrim (SCOS)

This mod adds a sentient race of chairs to the world of Skyrim.

The ESP for this mod is an ESP-FE.

This mod is intended to add a bit of humor to the game. It started as a joke between friends, but after rigging up a demo of a sentient chair and laughing hard, I decided to make this into a full mod.

I plan to add more Chair NPCs, a few quests, and possibly a dungeon.

## Sentient Chair Lore

In the first century following the end of the Oblivion Crisis, many chairs in Skyrim developed the properties of Black Soul Gems. Upon absorbing the souls of sentient beings, these chairs became sentient themselves. These chairs gained the ability to procreate and soon formed a race of their own native to Skyrim.

Chairs are nearly immortal as they are completely resistant to aging, disease, and poisons. They live as long as they remain intact. However, They can be killed. Being made of wood, they are weak to fire.

Sentient Chair's lineage from actual chairs has made them proficient at pickpocketing, shock magic, and sneaking (no one suspects a chair). Sentient chairs lack hands and cannot wield weapons. Also, the craftsmen of Skyrim have not made armor for chairs. Luckily for the chairs, they are made of sturdy wood that provides the same protection as armor.

Unfortunately, Nords hunted Chairs as trophies to near extinction. Few chairs from the first generations survive today, and chairs in Skyrim no longer become sentient on their own. How chairs became sentient in the first place is a mystery lost to time.

## Features

### Voiced NPCs

Sentient Chairs

* Chairman Needlecushion (Winterhold - Frozen Hearth Inn)
* Thurston Snugglebottoms (Whiterun - Dragonsreach)

Other

* Herman Miller (Whiterun - Herman Miller Stables)

### Leveled NPCs

Chair Wizard Bandits - Some chairs of Skyrim have taken to banditry and lurk anywhere you can find bandit wizards.

Warlock Chairs - The magick skills of Sentient Chairs make them excellent warlocks. They practice every discipline except fire. Some of the best Storm Warlocks in Skyrim are chairs! Warlock Chairs inhabit any hovel where warlocks hone their craft.

* Conjurers
* Ice Mages
* Necromancers
* Storm Mages
* Storm Mage Bosses

Forsworn Chair Shamans - In 4E 174, Sentient Chairs of The Reach joined the Forsworn uprising. Many Reach chairs are still loyal Forsworn to this day. Forsworn Chairs serve as Shamans in Forsworn encampments. Some have even become Forsworn Warlords.

Giant Chairs - When chairs gained sentience through absorbing souls, some chairs absorbed the souls of Giants. Aside from being much larger, giant sentient chairs differ from others by wielding giant clubs through magick. Giant Chairs are rare but can be found among the giant camps and migration paths.

Chair Hardness - Chairs have a natural armor that scales with the quality of the chair. The Dragonborn will encounter common wooden chairs with armor rating equivalent to a full set of iron armor at lower levels. The Dragonborn will encounter great thrones with armor ratings equivalent to a full set of Daedric armor at higher levels.

### Chair Horses

Herman Miller descends from a long line of Skyrim hostlers. When the chairs of Skyrim began to absorb souls and become sentient, the Millers were able to create Chair Horses.

Chair Horses were rare, to begin with, and now Herman Miller has a single Chair Horse for sale at his stables outside of Whiterun near the Battle-Born Farm.

Herman Miller can also teach you a spell, free of charge, to change the style of your Chair Horse. If you really want to mix it up, he also has an enchanted ring for sale that will change the style of your chair horse every 15 seconds.

### Chair Weapons

The Nords of Skyrim hunted Sentient Chairs for their sturdiness. Some even adopted them as weapons. Chair weapons can be found on or in hostile enemies, bosses, chests, and vendors. They can be crafted and Blacksmith Forges and upgraded at grindstones.

The chair weapons are warhammers, and each matches a warhammer from the base game. Each chair weapon has a different look.

* Common Chair (similar to Iron Warhammer)
* Wooden Chair (similar to Steel Warhammer)
* Orcish Chair (similar to Orchish Warhammer)
* Dwarven Chair (similar to Dwarven Warhammer)
* Elven Chair (similar to Elven Warhammer)
* Glass Throne (similar to Glass Warhammer)
* Ebony Throne (similar to Ebony Warhammer)
* Daedric Throne (similar to Daedric Warhammer)

### Loading Screens

Eleven (11) loading screens have been added that contain sentient chair lore and information about specific sentient chairs.

### Dead Chair Loot

All Sentient Chairs drop firewood and a filled black soul gem. Leveled NPCs also drop the normal loot found in similar NPCs.

## Installation

### Requirements

[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) and [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)](http://skse64.silverlock.org/) both must be installed before installing this mod.

### Recommended

[Static Mesh Improvement Mod - SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659). Will improve the looks of Chair NPCs.

### NMM/Vortex

Download and install with Vortex and the FOMOD installer will take care of the rest.

### Manual

* Extract the 7z file using 7-Zip.
* Copy the extracted `MarkekrausSentientChairsOfSkyrim.esp` and `MarkekrausSentientChairsOfSkyrim.bsa` files to the `data` folder under your Skyrim: Special Edition installation folder.
* Enable the plugin using whatever method you usually use.

### Load Order

I recommend using [LOOT - Load Order Optimisation Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1918) as it will automatically place this mod in the correct load order.

This mod should be placed somewhere after the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) and before any mods that change NPC behaviors.

Load this mod after [Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173) if you have it installed. If not, there may be some AI pathing issues near Herman Miller Stables.

## User Guide

Visit the NPCs, have a chat, interact with them!

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with everything. However, any mods that change vanilla chair meshes/textures may unexpectedly change the Chair NPCs' look.

Mods that change the leveled enemies lists might have issues. Therefore, I recommend installing this mod before other mods so those mods overwrite the behavior of this mod. This may result in chairs not spawning as leveled enemies.

If there is a particular NPC behavior mod that you would like this mod to be affected by, request it in the discussion. This mod should be compatible with any of them, but Chair NPCs may not be completely affected.

I have confirmed the NPCs in this mod can be controlled by [Amazing Follower Tweaks SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6656). If you want to add the Sentient Chairs as followers, I suggest using AFT.

This mod updates several of the base game leveled lists in a way that is mostly compatible with other mods that do so. Mod load order should not matter. However, suppose other mods reset leveled item lists to master defaults. In that case, these changes will not persist and will result in Chair Weapons not being found in the world or sold by vendors.

This mod is compatible with [Immersive Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16788). No patches are required, and load order does not matter. This mod updates several leveled item lists to add the Chair Weapons where other warhammers are already present.

This mod is compatible with [Valdacil's Item Sorting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5224). No patches are required, and load order does not matter. Chair Weapons will be automatically prefixed correctly if the mod is present.

## Warning: Not Lore-Friendly and Swearing

This mod is technically not lore-friendly. However, the lore in this mod does not re-write any lore in the game. Instead, it adds sentient chair lore to the existing lore. Sentient chair lore attempts to be consistent within itself and with existing lore.

The dialogue in this mod may contain language that may not be appropriate for all audiences.
